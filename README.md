## Authors: Ovidiu Boitor, Florin Stoica, Romeo Mihăilă, Laura Florentina Stoica and Laura Stef 
This is the code repository for the paper _Automated Machine Learning to Develop Predictive Models of Metabolic Syndrome in Patients with Periodontal Disease_.  
We used Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks to build predictive models in order to determine which of these risk factors exhibits the most robust association with metabolic syndrome. 
To gain confidence in the results provided by the machine learning models provided by the AutoML pipelines, we used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values for the interpretability of these models, from a global and local perspective.
Contains practical approaches for the following AutoML frameworks:
- Auto-sklearn 
- H2O AutoML
## Notes on Environment Setup
There are two CSV files with example data for training and testing.
Software package versions: Python 3.8.X, Auto-sklearn 0.14.3, H2O cluster version 3.36.0.1
